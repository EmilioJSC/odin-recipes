        <ol>
            <li>Step 1</li>
              <p>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.<p>
            <li>Step 2</li>
              <p>Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. <br>
                Add ground beef and bread crumbs and mix with your hands or <br>
                a fork until well blended. Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.</p>
            <li>Step 3</li>
              <p>Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 <br>
                minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read <br>
                thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees</p>
